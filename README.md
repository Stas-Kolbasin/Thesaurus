See Docs.txt for basic specification.

=== The Challenge ===

We want you to build a thesaurus solution. Please use the definition presented on
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesaurus as a reference.

*Feature I – A .NET Thesaurus Library*
Please implement a thesaurus in .NET. It should have the following functionality (expressed by these
user stories):
• As a user I want to be able to add a word with some synonyms to the thesaurus, so that I can
extend the content of the thesaurus.
• As a user I want to be able to get synonyms for a word from the thesaurus, so that I can use
this knowledge to impress my friends.
• As a user I want to be able to list all words in the thesaurus, so that I know which words the
thesaurus knows about.

*Feature II – A .NET Thesaurus Web API*
Please use .NET to implement a Web API. It should have the following functionality:
• As a user of the thesaurus library I want to do all thesaurus operations from a Web API so
that I can decouple my system.

*Feature III – A Thesaurus UI*
Using the Web API from feature II, create a UI experience that can fully interact with the thesaurus.
Feel free to add any extra features to the experience, but focus on solving the core problem first.
Implement this feature using a JavaScript framework such as Ember, Knockout, Angular, Backbone or
similar.
